1. Generate a 2d heightmap using Perlin Noise 
2 . Convert height values into terrain types (water, grass ,ets);
Water (0.0 - 0.3) → Deep water, lakes, ocean
Sand/Beach (0.3 - 0.4) → Shorelines
Grasslands (0.4 - 0.6) → Plains, forests
Hills (0.6 - 0.8) → Slightly elevated areas
Mountains (0.8 - 1.0) → High peaks

3. add biomes (forest , mountains ,deserts).
4. Implement river generation (flow from high to low terrain).
5 . Add village , cites (based on terrain features).
6. create roads connecting villages.
7.display the map visually using matplotlib or pygamesh
